When a highly elastic ball is thrown between two plates, the ball reverses direction under certain conditions. This project focused on explaining the physics behind this phenomenon as well as creating a simulation to predict the motion. The results were compared visually and numerically to experimental data.

This project was originally presented at the 2015 [New Zealand Young Physicists' Tournament](https://iypt.org.nz/). The problem was:

> Throw a highly elastic ball into the space between two plates. The ball starts bouncing and under some circumstances can even be projected back to you. Investigate the motion of the ball and parameters influencing the motion, including the orientation of the plates.
