Amplifying signals is an easy way to make sounds louder. However, amplifying and attenuating sounds without extra external energy input is much more difficult. This report tests cheap and efficient devices such as lenses which can be used to amplify or attenuate acoustics passively. Uses for these include targeted alarm clocks and reducing noise pollution in areas of high road traffic.

The idea for this project originates from previous work done as preparation for a problem in the 2016 [International Young Physicists' Tournament](http://iypt.org/Home). The problem was:

> Fresnel lenses with concentric rings are widely used in optical applications, however a similar principle can be used to focus acoustic waves. Design and produce an acoustic lens and investigate its properties, such as amplification, as a function of relevant parameters.
